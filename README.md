# GitHub-Changelog-Generator

Do you want to generate pretty releases changelogs? GitHub-Changelog-Generator is there for you!

Install it, open a GitHub diff and click on the extension icon in your browser.
Pick some commits, write some text, and here you go!

Notes:
 - this extension **won't** interact with the GitHub webpage, it only reads its content
 - it has some enhancement margin (adding jquery & vuejs to VCS isn't really a good practice)
 - there are some bugs, don't even try to edit the generated content before adding some more changelog entries
 - only compatible with GitHub (sorry, SVN isn't supported for now)
 - only compatible with Google Chrome (haven't tested on Firefox, it may work but I wouldn't bet on this)
 - may break if not used properly
 - if you find some oddities in the code, please know that I wasn't drunk when I wrote this code, but not fully awaken either
